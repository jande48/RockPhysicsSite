# fluid_sub
The Gassman equations are the most widely used approach to model the effects of fluids on rock velocity and density. These models are useful to interpret fluid types by comparison with seismic response and amplitude versus offset. The mathematical formulation of the workflow in this python script is presented in Smith et al., 2003. https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1567211

This Python script calculates primary and shear velocity (Gassman subsitution) from sonic logs.  A Texaco Wilcox well is used as an example log, and this data is read from 'Texaco_Wilcox_original.cvs'

Thanks to Tad Smith for teaching the Gassman Fluid subsitution workflow.
